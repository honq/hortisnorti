# hortisnorti

Python script that uses your poesessid to sort specific stashtabs that should ONLY contain horticrafting benches.
Outputs CSV that has crafts and quantity of crafts in groups like Augements, removes, reforges, etc.

To get working-------------------------------

Fill in three things at the top of the script, accountname, poesessid, and the tab/tabs you want to find horticrafts in

username = 'youraccountname' #account username

poesessid = 'yourpoesessID' #chrome://settings/cookies/detail?site=pathofexile.com

tabindex = ['17','18'] #count starts at 0, put tabs containing only horticrafting benches
